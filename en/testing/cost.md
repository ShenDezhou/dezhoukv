The random storage of about 1000000 KEYs, 2315811 DRAMs, 5782843 SSDs, 577667 HDD. DRAM: SSD1: HDD accounts for about 26.7: 66.7: 6.6. the random access ability of HDD in accordance with the theoretical value of 4: 10: 1. HDDs have poor performance because of high search time and low I/O concurrency. Random read/write operations are more representative of normal system activity and are generally constrained by IOPS.
