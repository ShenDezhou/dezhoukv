The extensibility of the system can be divided into three aspects: partitioning extensibility, node extensibility, and mixed expansibility. First of all, each partition can increase nodes, which can synchronously expand the size of each partition to maintain system performance. Secondly, partitioning can be deployed across nodes, that is, the system can be set up as a distributed cluster. Finally, different partitions can connect to different backend file systems. For large files optimized file systems, SogouQDB can be used to deploy file systems. For small file optimized file system, backend file systems can be deployed in the way of LevelDB.
