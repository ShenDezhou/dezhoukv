Through the DezhouKV database, we make full use of the resources such as DRAM, SSD, and HDD, adopt the Maglev algorithm to reduce the KEY migration, and adopt the Murmurhash3_128 fast unencrypted hash algorithm, which is short text Ben Hash security. Considering the characteristics of the file system with different size files running on HDD, the paper adopts SogouQDB/LevelDB to store HDD. The whole system satisfies four characteristics of universality, extensibility, high performance and high availability. It is an ideal storage model. The system performance under different storage utilization rate is counted, and the basic performance measurement is carried out on a real machine.
