The KEY space is divided into three regions with different speed and slipped through the hash collision processing, DRAM, SSD, HDD three kinds of medium speed, capacity is represented by the 3 order determinant, said the speed and capacity characteristics of the first two rows of 33 matrix, third lines define KEY storage location, at the same time constraints the third line of the range, constructed a 15 billion KEY and the value of determinant mapping.
When DRAM is full, the KEY will be inserted into the SSD directly, so that this KEY will take a MISS when read, and increase the access to DRAM once;
In the same way, when SSD is full, KEY is inserted into the HDD directly, and this KEY will take a MISS when read, and increase the access to SSD once.
The proportion of KEY DRAM:SSD:HDD this mapping algorithm was 25%:62.5%:6.25%, while the storage ratio is 1:1000:10000, so the discussion of 0.009%~10%, the similar performance of single SSD can approximate to 11-23 000 IOPS, when the space utilization rate of 10%, the performance of the system is approximately HDD-Redis-LevelDB, approximately 200 IOPS, [135000170008500.05666.74250.03400.02833.32428.52125.01888.81720.0] /testing/image.png ("the different space! The use rate of system IOPS value") in different space of the whole system utilization rate of IOPS can be approximated by the above said.
