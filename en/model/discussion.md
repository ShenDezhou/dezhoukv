In theory, the average response time should be the number of bars saved by each hardware multiplied by the speed of the hardware and divided by the total number of bars.![公式名](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?t=%5cfrac%7b%5csum%20r_i*n_k}%7b%5csum%20n_k}),    
R & amp; lt; sub I is the hardware response time n & amp; lt; k & amp; lt; is the number of KEY. Therefore, the average KV response time of this paper is 0.6\ 1 140\ / 10 / 16, the average response time is 7.4 ns and the theoretical IOPS is 135,000. Suppose that the average response time is 0.6 ns, HDD is 6 000 nsSSD is 140 ns, and the 3-Hierarchical architecture item ratio is 410: 1: 1.
