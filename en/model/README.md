We design a three-dimensional space to represent structured data. After normalization of structured data, each element is represented by u vector, and the state of all elements in 3D space is represented by cu. When a medium space is full, Elements mapped to this space will be searched according to the degradation rule (degradation rule: that is, KEY is from the high speed medium, can not be found to the low speed medium lookup, query to other media.
