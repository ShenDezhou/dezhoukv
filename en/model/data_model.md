A structured data is mapped to 128bit according to MurmurHash3_128, and the three-dimensional volume value of 64bit is obtained from the high 64bit and the low 64bit. After normalization, a value of -10 & amp; sup > 10\ 10 & amp; sup > 9 & amp; amp; lt; interval is obtained, and a value is obtained in the range of 10 & amp; GT; 10 & amp; lt; 10 & amp; lt; 10 & amp; lt; 10 & amp; GT;（Normalized formula：![归一化](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?f(x%29=xmod({1.5*{10^{10}}}%29-{7.5*{10^{9}}})）Then the value of vector z is obtained according to the formula of quick calculation.
