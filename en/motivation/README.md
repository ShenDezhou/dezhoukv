U vector measures data storage position, v vector measures the speed characteristics of the equipment medium DRAM/SSD/HDD, and w vector measures the storage capacity of the equipment. We predefine the storage capacity of the device. We define i(1,0,0), j(0,1,0), k(0,0,1) as the data stored on the DRAM,SSD,HDD. The determinant uvw denotes the oxyz three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The volume generated by the next three vectors u,v,w. Therefore, for each key, the volume of a 128bit hash and the determinant cuvw is a surjection after hash calculation. We define the constant c belogs to (0,1]. uvw determinant=![公式名](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?$$%5cbegin{bmatrix}u_{1}&u_{2}&u_{3}\\v_{1}&v_{2}&v_{3}\\w_{1}&w_{2}&w_{3}%5cend{bmatrix}$$)
