The system is divided into three layers by dividing the data into three layers, and the average response time of the system is as follows: 3.378-10.09) and 10.0910 / 100).![公式名](http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5cbar%7bV}=0.03378*V_1+0.06712*V_2+0.8991*V_3)，Assuming the response time of V / sub 1 / 135,000 V & amp; sub; 2 / 1 / 17000 V & amp; sub; the response time of the 50% utilization rate of 1 / 3 / 3 0000N / V, then the theoretical average is 1 / 3 722. 5, that is, the theoretical average IOPS of the system is 3 722. 5. The design of three layers can give full play to the performance of heterogeneous nodes (heterogeneous: different node devices have different memory SSD space and HDD space) while retaining flexibility and efficiency.
